# COVID-autumn-forecast

data available at [pcm-dpc covid repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/blob/master/dati-json/dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.json)

(latest sample: 08/09/2020)

## Idea

this repo contains a script that creates some charts about coronavirus spreading in italy

#### future work:

- set a script that downloads the most recent data
- create new charts with better graphics
- add some predictions
- write the results in this readme
